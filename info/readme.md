Terminal Poker
==============

A tool for analysis of long term poker strats.

## Beta Release

Players limp into the pot and check until the showdown...

Player decisions will be improved next release.

## Usage

**New usage --** you can also pump stdin into the program to affect number of rounds and number of players -- more on this later.

Begin by running make in the base directory.

Then run the executable poker with command line arguments specifying number of rounds to play, and whether you want a pretty output or output as a csv.

And example usage for N hands with csv formatted output is below:

    ./poker N 0
